## Basics

### Creating hooks

The `link` command always creates bidirectional hooks. Give it two or more files or urls and it will create links between them. By default it links all files to the last file in the list. Add the `--all` flag to link all files to every other file in the list. This can be abbreviated as `hook ln -a file1.md file2.pdf "https://brettterpstra.com"`.

Similar to the way you would use the GUI, you can use `hook clip file1.md` to copy a Hook URL to the clipboard (aliased as `cp`), and then use `hook ln -p file2.pdf` to create a link from the clipboard to `file2.pdf`.

You can also clone all of the links on one file to another, great for adding a new file to a group that's fully crosslinked. Just use `hook clone file1.md file2.pdf`.

### Listing hooks

Use the `list` (aliased as `ls`) command to list all attached hooks for a file. With no output format specified, `ls` will show the paths to all hooks, or the hook url if the hook doesn't have a file path (e.g. a URL). You can specify an output format using `--output_format` (abbreviated as `-o`) with one of "markdown", "hooks", "paths", or "verbose". Formats can be abbreviated to their first letter, so to display a Markdown list of all hooked files, use `hook ls -o m file1.md`.

### Removing hooks

Use `hook remove file1.md file2.pdf` to remove the bidirectional link between `file1.md` and `file2.pdf`. Add the `--all` flag (abbr. `-a`) with one or more files to remove ALL the hooks on them. This option requires confirmation.

#### Super nerdy scripting trick

The `--output_format=paths` option (abbr. `-o p`) combined with the `--files_only` flag (abbr. `-f`) will list just the paths and only include hooks that have file paths (i.e. exclude web, email, and other URLs). This can be combined with `--null` to output the list using a NULL separator, perfect for use with `xargs` or other command line tools.

### Acting on hooks

You can open a hooked file or URL by running `hook select file1.md`. This will display a menu of all the hooks on `file1.md`, and entering the number of a selection will open that file in its default application.

You can also open a file in the Hook GUI using `hook open file1.md`.

### Searching hooks

Use `hook find` (or `hook search`) and a search string to find bookmarks containing that string in the title, path, or url. Use `hook find -n` to search bookmark names only. All of the options from `hook ls`/`hook list` (output format, files only, null separator, etc.) work with `find`/`search`. See `hook help find` for details.

`hook find` with no search string will list all bookmarks. This can be used with the same output options as `hook ls`.

### Shell completion

Use `hook scripts [SHELL]` to output a completion script for your specified shell (currently `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish` are available). The comment at the top of the output will guide you to install and utilize the script.
